      <div id="hideaway" style="display:none;"><h2>Today</h2>Short visits in your neighborhood could catapult you into some negative situations, Leo. 
        It's best to stay close to home if you can. 
        An angry letter or call could put you in a shaky mood. 
        This isn't a day to socialize. 
        Days like this are best spent keeping to yourself and throwing your energy into taking care of whatever you're working on.

     <div id="hideawa" style="display:none;"><h2>Yesterday</h2>There is irony in yesterday's situation, Leo. 
        The only real remedy for situations like this is to accept them and joke about it. 
        If you try to take yourself too seriously, especially when it comes to art or romance, you will inevitably fail. 
        Your heart is sensual and your emotions profound. 
        Bring yourself into balance by laughing instead of crying about the events of the day. <br> <br></div>
     <div id="hideaw" style="display:none;"><h2>Tomorrow</h2>Leo, you hide your emotional needs from others. 
        You need to be able to trust someone in order to share your feeling. 
        They have to guess at your deepest secrets. 
        Today you could save a lot of time in your love life if you just tell your partner what you want out of your relationship or even what you'd like to change about it. 
        Talk about it. 
        Your partner is listening.</div>
