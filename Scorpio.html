      <div id="hideaway" style="display:none;"><h2>Today</h2>Uncertainty about spiritual matters and doubt about your insights might have you down in the dumps today. Don't try to force any solutions - it won't work. This isn't a good day to be out and about, because travel of any kind could pose problems. This is also a bad day to plan or start a vacation. Stay close to home and take care of practicalities, Scorpio. That way you will be calm by evening.

     <div id="hideawa" style="display:none;"><h2>Yesterday</h2>Things may get a bit difficult in your romantic life because of someone in the partnership who isn't necessarily taking a very realistic approach to the situation, Scorpio. There's a bit of a power play going on as someone tries to throw their weight around without considering the other person's feelings. Tension is brewing, and you'd be wise to deal with it now. <br> <br></div>
     <div id="hideaw" style="display:none;"><h2>Tomorrow</h2>You may have doubts over the next few days, Scorpio. Don't make any important decisions about your future during this relatively unproductive period. If someone in your professional or personal life asks you to make more of a commitment, you may be tempted to put on the brakes without really knowing why. Wait a while before answering this kind of question.</div>
