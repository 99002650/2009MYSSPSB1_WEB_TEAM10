      <div id="hideaway" style="display:none;"><h2>Today</h2>Stay close to home today, Taurus. 
        Spending too much time in the car could lead to stress or, in extreme cases, minor accidents.
         On the job, this could turn out to be one of those days. 
         Avoid office politics and stay out of arguments. 
         Try to sequester yourself and do your work alone.
          Days like this are best used to take care of your affairs quickly and efficiently.

     <div id="hideawa" style="display:none;"><h2>Yesterday</h2>You may be trying to get to the end of the road too quickly without really enjoying all the steps along the way, Taurus. 
        This is especially true when it comes to any sort of artistic project or romantic partnership that you might be involved in at this time. 
        If you aren't savoring every part of your journey, then perhaps this isn't the path you should be on. 
        <br> <br></div>
     <div id="hideaw" style="display:none;"><h2>Tomorrow</h2> For a month you may have had problems communicating with the people close to you, Taurus. 
        This is nothing to worry about, yet it might make you feel off balance.
         This is a great day to settle conflicts from the last month or make your feelings clear to other people. 
         Don't be afraid to play "truth or dare." Honesty is the best policy.
          Dare them to be honest with you.</div>
