      <div id="hideaway" style="display:none;"><h2>Today</h2> Money matters might take a turn for the worse today.
         Don't fly off the handle because of this, Gemini. 
         Use every bit of financial savvy you have to put things straight. 
         Try to remain calm and collected when dealing with stubborn people.
          Don't be drawn into arguments. You will be able to pull everything together again, but only by your ingenuity. Don't depend on others..

     <div id="hideawa" style="display:none;"><h2>Yesterday</h2>When your heart is gently touched, it feels loving, generous, and supportive of everyone, Gemini.
         If your heart is lonely, it feels deserted by everyone.
          It would be impossible to try to make sense of why things need to be so extreme for you, but the fact of the matter is that you don't need to figure it out rationally.
           You only need to accept that this is how you feel. 
           <br> <br></div>
     <div id="hideaw" style="display:none;"><h2>Tomorrow</h2>Gemini, you tend to live your life vicariously through your partner.
         Today you may come to the realization that this isn't healthy for you. 
         You may realize that you give more of yourself than you get back, draining you of energy.
          In fact, you're almost completely out. Be selfish today. 
          You need to do something for you for once, and it's about time!</div>
