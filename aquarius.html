      <div id="hideaway" style="display:none;"><h2>Today</h2>Too much running around might have you feeling exhausted and under the weather today, Aquarius. You may have been exercising a little too much. Therefore, this is a good day to avoid exercise and get some rest. Don't push yourself too hard! This isn't a good day to plan or start a vacation. Wait a few days, as trips planned at this time could be fraught with glitches.

     <div id="hideawa" style="display:none;"><h2>Yesterday</h2>When it comes to romance, your body is apt to turn to jelly. You may be so emotional that you can't function, Aquarius. That's love. And even though it can be heavenly, it can also be debilitating. You could deliberate for hours about an issue because you don't want to make a move without your partner's input. If you don't have a romantic partner now, find one soon.<br> <br></div>
     <div id="hideaw" style="display:none;"><h2>Tomorrow</h2>If you feel you've been looking to the past lately, Aquarius, it's in order to liberate yourself from it. You may feel like revisiting your childhood or rekindling certain relationships with old friends. But the planets are making you a bit too romantic, and the reality of things will disappoint you. Looking backward isn't the best way to move toward the future. Nostalgia isn't what it used to be!</div>
