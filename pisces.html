      <div id="hideaway" style="display:none;"><h2>Today</h2>You could feel extremely passionate today, Pisces. You might want to connect with a love partner but be prevented by circumstances. You might be attracted to racier novels or movies. Repressed anger could bubble up from your subconscious and seek an outlet. This is a great day to channel that anger into some artistic activity. Don't be surprised if you use a lot of red!

     <div id="hideawa" style="display:none;"><h2>Yesterday</h2>Will you go out with me? Be careful if a person says yes when you ask that question today, Pisces. You could take the nature of this situation to the extreme. Saying yes doesn't mean you're suddenly in charge of his or her life. Nor are you responsible for anything that person does or how they feel. If you're still asking the question without getting any positive responses, don't worry. Keep trying. <br> <br></div>
     <div id="hideaw" style="display:none;"><h2>Tomorrow</h2>Sometimes your relationships are like magnets, Pisces. When you want to get close, the other person tries to get away from you. When you take a step back, he or she runs back into your life. Human nature is complex. Right now, you're probably taking a step back, although you haven't given up completely. This rest will give you time to think about which side of you is the most magnetic.</div>
