      <div id="hideaway" style="display:none;"><h2>Today</h2>If a friend or acquaintance gives you advice about money or investments today, don't take it. To follow this unknowledgeable person's lead might prove to be disastrous. Participation in group activities also isn't advisable. They could get out of hand, and you could find end up in the middle of an angry crowd. This is a great day to stay home, Sagittarius. Work on your own project.

     <div id="hideawa" style="display:none;"><h2>Yesterday</h2>Your creative juices are flowing freely, Sagittarius, but there appears to be a roadblock. Something or someone apparently doesn't want you to continue down the path you're on. Perhaps he or she is scared that you're going to discover a whole new passion in life that they don't necessarily agree with. Don't forget who is running your show - you and no one else.<br> <br></div>
     <div id="hideaw" style="display:none;"><h2>Tomorrow</h2> What are you afraid of, Sagittarius? Is it contact with other people? It's as if an invisible rope were holding you back from getting close to people, or worse, pulling you back. What's this about? You're going through a period that's closely linked to your past. A failed relationship still haunts you and casts its shadow on the current one. Get rid of the skeletons in your closet!</div>
