      <div id="hideaway" style="display:none;"><h2>Today</h2>Electrical or plumbing problems with your house might come up. 
        Call a professional, Aries. Don't try to fix it yourself, because you could make it worse. 
        Friends might want to visit but tell them to wait until another day. 
        Discussions could quickly deteriorate into arguments today.
         This is a great day to work quietly alone on whatever interests you the most.

     <div id="hideawa" style="display:none;"><h2>Yesterday</h2>Powerful issues arise in your life that make it difficult to find peace, Aries.
         Perhaps your first tendency is to confide in your partner. 
         More than likely, this person is contributing to the difficulties you're now having.
          Your best bet is to spend some time alone. If you're already alone, so much the better. 
          Cherish this time instead of letting it make you mad. 
          <br> <br></div>
     <div id="hideaw" style="display:none;"><h2>Tomorrow</h2>You're entering a period of doubt, especially about your love life. 
        You like your relationships and feelings to be clear.
         You may think a lot about your relationships over the next few days.
          Are you sure you've chosen the right person? Are his or her feelings sincere? 
          Could you live without this person? The next two months will bring you the answers.
           Don't forget, no one is perfect..</div>
