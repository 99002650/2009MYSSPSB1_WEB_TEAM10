      <div id="hideaway" style="display:none;"><h2>Today</h2>Gossip and bad feelings among co-workers or in a group could occur today, and there might be some political shenanigans that it would be in your best interests to avoid. This isn't a good day to go to lunch with co-workers. Get away by yourself. Don't believe anything you hear. Chances are it isn't true. Keep to yourself and don't offer any opinions, Capricorn. To do so might be unfortunate.

     <div id="hideawa" style="display:none;"><h2>Yesterday</h2>At the end of the day, you're the one who has to look in the mirror and know who you are, Capricorn. Think about this the next time you're tempted to make a rude comment or spread a displeasing fact about someone else. One side of you may be able to rationalize behavior that the other side simply despises. Look at both of sides of yourself, not just the one that pleases you. <br> <br></div>
     <div id="hideaw" style="display:none;"><h2>Tomorrow</h2>It's very possible that you will want to take a step back today in order to take a closer look at your relationships. Your address book is full of names. Your phone rings off the hook. You receive tons of texts and emails every day. Yet isn't it funny that you feel alone? It's time to get rid of the superficial relationships and concentrate on those that really mean something to you.</div>
