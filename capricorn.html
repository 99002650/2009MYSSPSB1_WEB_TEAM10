      <div id="hideaway" style="display:none;"><h2>Today</h2>Is your significant other caught up in family problems 
        and unable to spend time with you? Don't let your insecurity get the best of you.
        Your partner needs to deal with family now. 
        Relax, do what you want to do, and have confidence
        that you'll be spending more time together as soon as possible.
        After dealing with family quarrels, you'll be a peaceful refuge for your partner.

     <div id="hideawa" style="display:none;"><h2>Yesterday</h2>Inspiration could hit today, Libra.
       It's a beautiful feeling, but you might not be sure how to channel it.
      It could represent a spiritual breakthrough, artistic inspiration,
      increased understanding of others, or all of the above. 
      What's almost certain is that you'll want to spend time alone
      to take it all in and figure out how to use it. Don't dismiss any possibility, 
      however outrageous it may seem. <br> <br></div>
     <div id="hideaw" style="display:none;"><h2>Tommorrow</h2>Expect to receive interesting communications today, Libra.
       You might hear from a long-lost friend and have a chance to catch up on the news. 
       Perhaps you'll hear something about success in reaching a goal
        you've been striving for these past few months. 
        Expect some interesting conversations. 
        Have a great time exchanging ideas on everything from politics to child rearing.</div>
