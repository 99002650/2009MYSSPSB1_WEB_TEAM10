      <div id="hideaway" style="display:none;"><h2>Today</h2>Today you might be a bit worried about your financial affairs, Virgo. 
        A past mistake could have led to some rather upsetting consequences. 
        Now you need to harness every bit of skill you have in order to set things straight. 
        Your knowledge of modern technology could help. 
        A friend might try to pick a quarrel with you, but it's best to stay cool, neutral, and out of the discussion.

     <div id="hideawa" style="display:none;"><h2>Yesterday</h2>The hungrier you get, the more determined you will become, Virgo. 
        Be careful that your determination doesn't turn into desperation and neediness. 
        It's unattractive and will get you nowhere. 
        Keep on the upward spiral, and let determination turn into inspiration and cooperation. 
        You will find this especially true when it comes to matters of the heart. 
        You have a great deal of power. Put it to good use. <br> <br></div>
     <div id="hideaw" style="display:none;"><h2>Tomorrow</h2>Tomorrow you may want to change some of the moral and social values that get in the way of relationships. 
        After surmounting these kinds of obstacles yourself, and watching others struggle with them, you've decided that it's time to do away with them once and for all. 
        Just be careful to respect the private lives of the people close to you. 
        Not everyone is as open-minded as you are!</div>
